# Foodfight Tactics

Foodfight Tactics has long been a meme within the Teamfight Tactics community as a set that would happen if Kent became the lead designer of TFT. Since Mort is still the BDFL of TFT, Riot won't be making Foodfight Tactics.

Welcome the next best thing! Open source Foodfight Tactics! Build from the ground up with Rust to be **blazingly fast**, and better yet, completely web based! No more 2 week patch schedules and Riot Client issues haha!

On a serious note, if I violate some sort of policy and Riot sends me a cease and desist, I'm taking this down.

## Road Map
- [ ] Learn Rust
- [ ] Make web app
- [ ] Publish game
- [ ] Soju tries the game
- [ ] Get featured on TFT Clips
- [ ] Get infinite clout
- [ ] Anger Riot for trademark violation
- [ ] Take down website
- [ ] Apply to Riot Games as a SWE
- [ ] Get in because Foodfight Tactics was LIT
- [ ] Convince Mortdog to make Foodfight Tactics
- [ ] Everyone is happy, WOKEGE
